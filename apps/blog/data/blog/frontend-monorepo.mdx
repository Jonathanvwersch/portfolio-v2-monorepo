## Introduction

This post isn't about explaining what a monorepo is or why you should use one - there are plenty of good articles out there covering that already. Instead, I'm going to share what I've learned from building a solid monorepo system using tried and tested tools like tsup and Turbo, along with Typescript.

If you want to skip the explanation, feel free to check out the template repo [here](https://github.com/Jonathanvwersch/frontend-monorepo-boilerplate).

## Why I needed a monorepo

The main reason for using a monorepo was that I needed to share frontend code across multiple apps. I also wanted to be able to publish this shareable code to a registry. In my case, that was my own registry, but it could be npm or Github.

## The Repository Structure 

The repository was structured as follows:

```
my-frontend-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── app_1/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── turbo.json
│   ├── app_2/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── turbo.json
│   └── ...
├── packages/
│   ├── package_1/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── tsup.config.ts
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── package_2/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── tsup.config.ts
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── ...
│   └── tsup.config.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── turbo.json
```

This structure neatly separates our concerns (apps and packages) and allows us to run commands from the root of the repository.

## Apps

This is where all your frontend apps go. This might include an app built using NextJs, Svelte, or whatever framework (or lack thereof) you prefer. Each app exists in its own subdirectory with its own package.json config file.

If you want to import one of your internal packages into your app, you can do so by specifying the absolute path to the package in your package.json file. For example, your app's package.json might contain a dependency import that looks like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@frontend-monorepo/constants": "file:../../packages/constants",
  "@frontend-monorepo/react-design-system": "file:../../react-design-system"
}
```

This is the syntax if you use npm. The syntax for pnpm is slightly different:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@frontend-monorepo/constants": "workspace:*",
  "@frontend-monorepo/react-design-system": "workspace:*"
}
```

## Packages

This is where all the packages you want to share across your different apps live. Like the apps, each package exists in its own subdirectory and has its own package.json file. As for what types of packages you might have,you could have a separate package for your types, constants, and UI components.

## Using Turbo for the build system

[Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) is crucial in this monorepo setup. It orchestrates the build process across all the apps and packages. Imagine you have 10 different packages, and the packages depend on each other. For instance, you might have a hooks package, which imports, and therefore is dependent on, a constants and types package. In that case, it is important that both the constants and types packages get built before the hooks package. Turbo builds a complete dependency graph of your codebase and allows you to build your packages in the correct topological order. In addition to this, it will cache the build outputs of each of your packages, which can greatly increase build speeds. For instance, if you were to make a change to a file in one of your packages, it will only rebuild that package (and any packages which depend on that package).

To get started with Turbo, all you need to do is install Turbo and then add a turbo.json file. I recommend adding a turbo.json file to the root of your repo with a config similar to that provided below. 

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "ui": "tui",
  "globalDependencies": [
    "**/.env.*",
    "package.json",
    "tsconfig.json",
    "turbo.json",
    "tsup.config.ts"
  ],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/*", ".tsbuildinfo"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/*", ".tsbuildinfo"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
``` 

The key part of the config is the dependsOn attribute, which allows you to perform the chosen command in topological order. For instance, by specifying build dependsOn build, you are basically asking Turbo to run the build command for each of your packages and apps that have the build commands as part of their package.json, but in dependency order, so that if one package depends on another, or if one of the apps depends on five of the packages, the dependent packages will be built first.

Each of the pipeline commands ("build", "dev", and "lint") should also be added as scripts to your root package.json. For instance, you could have a script in your root package.json called dev which would then run Turbo, e.g.:

```json
"dev": "turbo run dev",
```

And then in each of the apps and packages you wish to run in dev mode, you should have a separate script in their respective package.json files. For instance, if you use tsup for building your packages, each package would have a dev command that looks like:

```json
"dev": "tsup --watch",
```

and then your app, if it uses NextJs, would look like:

```json
"dev": "next dev",
```

Specifying the ui as "tui" enables usage of Turbo's updated CLI user interface, which uses a handy multi-pane interface to split up your running tasks. 

I'd recommend reading [Turbo's documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to get a better idea of the various config options. 

## Using tsup to orchestrate transpilation and type generation

With Turbo, we now have a build manager, but we still need tooling to actually perform the transpilation and type generation. The Typescript Compiler is the most obvious choice for this use, but it is really quite slow when it comes to transpilation, especially when compared with Esbuild. 

[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) is an easy-to-use bundling library, which uses esbuild for transpilation, as well as minification, code splitting, and tree shaking. It uses the Typescript Compiler to handle type generation. It also has an experimental type generation mode, which uses [Microsoft's API Extractor](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack), but we will get more into that later.

To get started with tsup, you will first need to install tsup, and then you'll need to add a tsup.config.ts file. If you are using tsup to handle transpilation for both your apps and packages, then it will probably make sense to include this config file in the root of your repo. In my case, tsup was only being used by the packages; my app, a NextJs app, has its own internal build system. 

A good starting point for your config file might look something like this:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'tsup'

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src/index.ts'],
  dts: true,
  format: ['cjs', 'esm'],
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true, 
  splitting: true,
  clean: true,
  treeshake: true, 
  minify: true,
  // ...
})
```

This setup tells tsup to:
- Use 'src/index.ts' as the entry point
- Output both CommonJS and ES Modules formats
- Generate type definitions
- Clean the output directory before each build

And while this would probably work on small projects, there are various optimizations you can make. 

For instance, I think it's worthwhile to disable certain config attributes while in development mode. I don't see much value in enabling splitting, minification, bundling, and tree shaking, as well as outputting both cjs and esm, while developing locally, as these steps just add extra overhead and slow down the build step. 

With that in mind, I think it would be sensible to update the config as follows, so as to only run these features in production (as well as main and staging):

```typescript
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV ?? "production";

export default defineConfig({
  treeshake: env !== "development",
  splitting: env !== "development",
  minify: env !== "development",
  bundle: env !== "development",
  format: env === "development" ? ["esm"] : ["esm", "cjs"],
  // ...
})
```

Additionally, an entry point of `src/index.ts` might be a bit too simple, or might not work at all if you do not use barrel files. A better approach would be to use a glob pattern to add all Typescript and Typescript React components, if you use React, that is:

```typescript
import * as glob from "glob";

const entries = glob.sync("./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}", {
  ignore: "**/*.spec.{ts,tsx}",
});
```

This has improved our config, but there is still one other issue you may come across as your frontend scales: tsup's built-in type generation can cause memory leaks (see https://github.com/egoist/tsup/issues/920). 

To avoid this, I recommend disabling tsup's type generation and just running a custom solution using `tsc` that runs on completion of the build step (onSuccess).

```typescript
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV ?? "production";

const tscParams = ["--emitDeclarationOnly"];

if (env === "development") {
  tscParams.push("--declarationMap");
}

export default defineConfig(() => ({
  dts: false, // Disable tsup's dts generation
  onSuccess: async () => {
    // Custom type generation logic using tsc
    spawnSync("tsc", tscParams, { stdio: "inherit" });
  },
  // ... other config
}));
```

This runs the Typescript Compiler without the build step and only emits type declarations. You could also set the experimentalDts config attribute to true, which would use Microsoft's API Extractor to generate the types. I've found this to be much quicker than Typescript's compiler for type generation, which is, by the way, the main bottleneck as far as speed is concerned, but its integration with tsup is still experimental and as such I have found it to lead to problems (see https://github.com/egoist/tsup/issues/1050).

Additionally, the function that runs on success will also output the declaration maps for your types. This is super useful as it essentially allows for the generation of source maps for .d.ts type files which map back to the original .ts source file. This means that if you use an editor like VS Code, when you click on the imported file, it will take you to the original .ts file and not the .d.ts file, which is not all that useful.

We're now in a good place with our tsup config, but there is one last missing step: handling our app in watch mode. Ideally, if any of our apps import any of our local packages, and we run our monorepo in watch mode, we'd like to see any changes we make to those imported packages reflected in our web app. tsup has a built-in watch mode that uses the library [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to watch for file changes, and then rebuild those files. But tsup's built-in watch mode has some limitations. For instance, if you add a file or rename a file, tsup will not detect that change and will not build the newly added file, or change the name of the renamed file. This applies to directories as well. To get around this, I've implemented a custom watcher script which I run on top of tsup's built-in watcher.

## Custom watcher script

The watcher script performs four main functions:

- Runs tsup in watch mode
- Restarts tsup when files and directories are added or deleted
- Reconciles src and dist directories when the watcher is killed
- Cleans up the type generation cache after each build

Let's go over each of these in more detail:

1. **Restarts tsup when files and directories are added or deleted**:
As mentioned previously, tsup uses the library Chokidar for listening to changes to files. The custom watch script also uses Chokidar. When it detects a file or directory addition (or deletion), it will restart the tsup instance. This essentially allows tsup to update the entries it watches to include the newly added files and directories, as well as remove the deleted files and directories.

```javascript
import { watch } from "chokidar";

const srcDir = path.join(cwd, "src");

const watcher = watch(["**/*.{ts,tsx}", "**/.*", "**/*/", "!node_modules/**"], {
  cwd: srcDir,
  persistent: true,
  ignoreInitial: true,
  alwaysStat: true,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 200,
    pollInterval: 100,
  },
});

function startTsup() {
  tsupProcess?.kill();

  tsupProcess = spawn("tsup", ["--watch"], {
    stdio: "pipe",
    shell: true,
    env: { ...process.env, NODE_ENV: "development" },
  });
}

watcher
  .on("add", () => {
    debounceAction(() => {
      startTsup();
    }, "Restarting tsup due to file addition");
  })
  .on("addDir", () =>
    debounceAction(() => {
      startTsup();
    }, "Restarting tsup due to directory addition")
  )
  .on("unlink", () => {
    debounceAction(() => {
      startTsup();
    }, "Restarting tsup due to file deletion");
  })
  .on("unlinkDir", () =>
    debounceAction(() => {
      startTsup();
    }, "Restarting tsup due to directory deletion")
  )
  .on("error", (error) => console.error(`Watcher error: ${error}`));
```

We debounce the calls of the startTsup function so as to prevent it from being called many times if we make a number of changes in a short period of time.

2. **Lack of reconciliation**: 

Tsup doesn't reconcile the `src` and `dist` directories. What this means is that if you delete a file or directory, that file will not be automatically removed from the dist or output directory. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that your code could point to files which no longer exist while you're developing locally. 

To tackle this, I wrote a custom recursive function that reconciles the src and dist directories. Initially, I would run this function every time a file or directory was deleted, but this proved problematic because, as was the problem in my case, NextJs has its own caching system, and its cache might still contain those deleted files. This means that if you were to remove them from the dist during the watch process, NextJs would crash, as I discovered. This might not be the case for whatever framework you are using, and in that case, you could call the reconciler on deletion of a file or directory.

I instead just perform the reconcilation when the watch script is killed. 

3. **Build caching**: 

Typescript allows for you to perform incremental compilation. What this means is that if you were running the monorepo in watch mode, and you change a file, only the types for the changed file would be created, and it would not create the types for the entire directory. I've enabled incremental compilation in watch mode by passing the --incremental flag to the tsc command. This will generate a .tsbuildinfo file for each package every time you run the watch mode, which will speed up type emission. The problem is that this cache can cause problems over time, and I generally recommend removing it after you've killed your watch script, as well as when you restart the tsup instance.

This is why I run the cleanUpTsbuild function every time a file/directory is added or deleted, as well as when the watch script is terminated.

## The final product

So that's it. That's how my frontend monorepo runs all of my packages and apps.
