I think I'm losing the ability to think and problem solve for myself. 

- Don't know what that error means? Ask an AI.
- Too lazy to read the docs? Ask an AI.
- Don't know what's wrong with your code? 

**ASK AN AI.** 

So I'm going on an AI detox. I've removed Codeium, I've uninstalled Cursor, and I'm going to back to raw-dogging my code for a bit. Because at the end of the day, you learn the most after suffering the hardest, and AI is simply too easy of a crutch to rely on constantly.

This doesn't mean that I'll stop working on any AI-related side projects, but from now on, I'm going to:

1. Write all the code myself
2. Read the docs
3. Find the bugs myself

And most importantly, actually start thinking for myself again.
